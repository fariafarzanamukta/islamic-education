        "description": "He experienced in his 63 years of blessed life more tribulation than a cohort. He ﷺ was an orphan, a widower, battle scarred, and unjustly outcast. He, ﷺ was defamed, mocked, lied to and lied about. He was poisoned and stoned. He ascended the Heavens and perfected worship. He ﷺ defended the weak and cured, miraculously by the power of Allah, the ill. He ﷺ epitomized compassion and comforted existence. Do we really know the seerah of Muhammad ﷺ",

It struck me that this small but informative book would be of immense benefit for non-Arabic speaking Muslims, spread all over the world, if translated into another foreign language. It is a known fact that huge numbers of new Muslims are attracted to Islam from different countries and different cultures. It is important that knowledge of Islam should be provided to them with great care and there should be no confusion in the basic religious knowledge imparted to them. Otherwise, we will be responsible for all the deviations which might crop up among these generations of new Muslims.",
