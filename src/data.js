He, ﷺ was defamed, mocked, lied to and lied about. He was poisoned and stoned. He ascended the Heavens and perfected worship. He ﷺ defended the weak and cured, miraculously by the power of Allah, the ill. He ﷺ epitomized compassion and comforted existence. Do we really know the seerah of Muhammad ﷺ",
